$stateParams mini project.

An angular app has already been set up for you, along with ui-router. Take a look at the app.js file to find that your states have been (mostly) set up for you.

If you run live-server, you should see an array of users.

Your task:

1. When a button is clicked on
  a. the id of that user will appear in the url as a url parameter
  b. and you should find yourself on the details route

2. When on the details state:
    a. the user's info of the button that was clicked on should be displaying
    b. the user's info that is being displayed should be based on the user id in the url

3. Show your mentors when you are finished.
